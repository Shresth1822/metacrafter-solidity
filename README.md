# EthProofBeginnerFinalProject
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

The MyToken contract includes the following main components:
* tokenName and tokenAbr: Public variables storing the name and abbreviation(abr) of the token.
* totalSupply: Public variable representing the total supply of tokens in circulation.
* balances: Mapping variable that associates addresses with their respective token balances.
* constructor(): Initializes the contract by setting the initial supply and assigning it to the deployer's address.
* mint(address _account, uint256 _value): Function to mint new tokens and assign them to a specified address.
* burn(address _account, uint256 _value): Function to burn (destroy) existing tokens.
